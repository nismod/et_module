This is the documentation of **et_module**.

.. note::

    The main objective of the et_module is to take
    energy outputs from the transportation model and
    do a temporal disaggregation to hourly.
    
    This is necessary as the outputs of the transportion model
    are annual. Most importantly, with help of this module
    different charging patterns of electric vehicles are 
    used to temporaly disaggregate electricity demand.
